To run file
1) open terminal
2) install mido library using "pip install mido"
2) run command "python main.py"

note: everytime the file is run the output file changes 

#####################################################################

To play output audio
1) download music player that can play .mid files and select it as default media player(example: windows media player)
2) open terminal
3) run command "./midi/out.mid"

####################################################################

To see transition matrix
1) open terminal
2) run command "./transitionmatrix.txt"

note: as the input midi file remains the same, the transition matrix will not change with new outputs

note: same method can be used for seeing countmatrix, the count matrix will not change with new outputs

# Music Generation using Markov Chains
This project demonstrates how to generate music using Markov chains based on existing MIDI files. By analyzing the structure and patterns in these files, we can create new compositions that retain similar style.
Markov chains are a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another based on certain probabilistic rules. In this project, we apply Markov chains to MIDI files, allowing us to create new musical sequences inspired by the input data.

How It Works
Data Preparation: The MIDI files are parsed to extract note sequences and their timing.
Markov Chain Model: A Markov model is built from the extracted sequences, where each note's transition to another note is based on the frequency of occurrence in the training data.
Music Generation: New sequences are generated by sampling from the Markov model, allowing for the creation of new musical pieces that resemble the original styles.
